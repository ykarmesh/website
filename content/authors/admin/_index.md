Hi! I am Karmesh, an AI Resident at FAIR, working with the Habitat team under the supervision of Dr. Oleksandr Maksymets and Prof. Dhruv Batra. 

I’m interested in robot learning, and have been researching how can we learn better visual representations for downstream training of Embodied AI agents. Previously, I worked as a Senior Robotics Engineer at ISEE, an autonomous vehicles startup based out of Boston, trying to automate the yard trucking space. I completed my Masters in Robotics Systems Development (MRSD) at the CMU Robotics Institute in 2020.
