Hi! I am Karmesh, a PhD student at Georgia Tech, advised by <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/" target="_blank">Prof. Dhruv Batra</a> and <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/" target="_blank">Prof. Zsolt Kira</a>. 

During my PhD I am interested in creating better pretraining strategies for Embodied AI agents. Previously, I was an AI Resident at FAIR, working with the Habitat and Cortex team under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/" target="_blank">Dr. Oleksandr Maksymets</a> and <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/" target="_blank">Prof. Batra</a>. Before that, I worked as a Senior Robotics Engineer at ISEE, an autonomous vehicles startup working on automating yard trucks. I completed my Masters in Robotics Systems Development (MRSD) at the CMU Robotics Institute in 2020.
