After the successful completion of my 2 year residency at FAIR, Meta, I have joined the Department of Interactive Computing at the School of Computer Science, Georgia Tech as a PhD student. I will be working with Prof. Dhruv Batra and Prof. Zsolt Kira, in the areas of representation learning and embodied AI.
